## The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People



### Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind (the principle of personal leadership)

- Humans have 4 endowments that make them different from animals:
  - Self-awareness: Can assess our own behavior, thought processes and identify areas of weakness and things that needs to be eliminated from our lives.
  
  - Conscience: deep inner awareness of right or wrong, and the degree to which our thoughts and actions are aligned with our values
  
  - Imagination: the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality
  
  - Independent will: the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free from other influence.
  
    

- We should begin with the end in mind: who I want to be, what I want to achieve. Visualize your funeral, write your eulogy. This visualization exercise will help me expand my perspectives beyond the here and now and helps me to get in touch with my innermost values.
- Begin with the end in mind stems from the principle: **All things are created twice**
  - The first creation happens in the mind (and then transferred onto a blueprint), and the second creation is the actual physical implementation/execution of my "blueprint"
    - I plan my garden/speech/house before I actually go ahead and build/create it.
- Some people earn "empty victories"-- they spend their whole lives working hard to get more money, recognition, and professional competencies. But in the end, they might realize that their "ladders" are leaning against the wrong wall. They were clearing the path in the "wrong jungle". They achieve things that they don't really care about in the first place, at the cost of things they actually care about.
  - It's easy to get into the trap of being seemingly "busy" and efficient, but not being effective because I am just working hard to go to the wrong place faster. 
  - So it is important to make sure what you are working towards things that are in harmony with correct principles. 
    - I need to use self-awareness to examine my thought processes, behaviors, and my values.
    - Use imagination to help me extract (through funeral exercises) what I am about and what I really want to achieve.
    - Use conscience to figure out if my values are in line with self-evident principles-- whether my map actually reflects the lighthouses/landscape.
- Whether I know it or not, the principle: **all things are created twice** still holds. 
  - The first creation can be by default or by proactive designs.
  - The first creation might come from scripts that are handed to us by other people's agendas, the pressures of circumstances, conditionings from our early years, rather than from principles.
  - Habit 1 says I am the creator (personal responsibility)
  - Habit 2 is the first creation (what do I want to accomplish; where am I leaning the ladder; personal leadership)
  - Habit 3 is the second creation (how can I best accomplish certain things; how to efficiently climb the ladder; personal management).
- Since most of us have a script handed to us by others/conditioning/circumstance, we need to use self-awareness to recognize ineffective scripts that are not congruent with our values and with self-evident correct principles. Next, we use our imagination to rescript ourselves (imagine an alternate self), and then live out my imagination.

- The most effective way to begin with the end in mind is developing a **personal mission statement**.
  - Each person's mission statement is unique-- it depends on what I value
  - But all of us should be responsible for my personal statement (basically my first creation), so that my behavior and attitude flows from my deepest values (maps), and that these values are in harmony with correct principles (landscape).
  - Think of the personal mission statement as a personal constitution-- it is fundamentally changeless, despite large and frequent changes in my environment.
  - To handle changes in life, I must have a changeless core so that I would know how to evaluate and respond to changes (make life decisions) based on a set of standards that I create for myself, in the midst of circumstances and emotions that affect our lives.
  - The ability to change (because of changing circumstances) is dependent on having a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about, and what you value. I can flow with changes in life-- I don't have to change myself to accommodate reality.
  - Once I have a sense of mission, I have the vision and value from which I set short- and long- term goals. I have a constitution, based on correct principles, from which every decision concerning the most effective use of my time, talents, and energies can be effectively measured.



**How to write personal mission statement?**

- I need to begin at the VERY CENTER of my Circle of Influence (contains our most basic maps/paradigms/lens through which we see the world)
- Self awareness: examine our maps and behaviors
- Conscience: use this as a compass to detect your own unique talents and ways you can make contribution (my raison d'etre). Use conscience to evaluate your values/maps and see if they describe the landscape (self-evident principles) 
- Imagination: mentally create the end we desire so that we give meaning, purpose, and direction to our lives 



- Whatever that is in our center of Circle of Influence is the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power.
  - Security: my sense of worth, identity, emotional anchorage, self-esteem
  - Guidance: my source of direction in life; standards or principles or criteria that guide my moment decision making and doing
  - Wisdom: my perspective on life, my understanding on how various parts and principles apply and related to each other. The extent to which your maps reflects the landscape
  - Power: faculty or capacity to act according to your own values instead of being act upon by other people and circumstance
- Security and clear guidance bring true wisdom, wisdom becomes the spark to direct and release power.



**Centers**

- Each of us has center of Circle of Influence/core paradigms.
- We can categorize Centers into several types-- you might have one or more types of centers.
- Your center will affect your security, guidance, wisdom, and power, which in turn impact the effectiveness of all aspects of your life.



A few example of Centers:

	- Spouse centerness: I have strong emotional dependence on your spouse and my security comes primarily from my spouse. I am vulnerable to the moods and feelings, and behavior and treatment of my spouse, or to any external event that impinge on my relationship with my spouse-- new child, in-laws, economic setbacks. Guidance is based on the emotion of the moment, and I derive no wisdom and power with spouse as my center.
	- Family centerness: I get my sense of security and personal worth from family tradition, culture, and reputation. I am vulnerable to changes in that tradition or culture. As a parent, I cannot raise children with their ultimate welfare truly in mind. Since my security comes from family, I rather be popular with my children than to do things that makes me less popular with them, but have positive impact on their growth and development. I might be guided by emotions "of the moment" (e.g., get angry if I see things that I think is improper behavior from my child). I care more about immediate concerns than the long-term growth and development of my child, and I overreact and punish out of bad temper.
	- Money centerness: I derive security from income and net worth. My self worth is dependent on how much I make. I become defensive/vulernable to anything that affects my net-worth. I derive no guidance, wisdom, and only a limited degree of power with money at the center. 
	- Work centerness: My identity stems from what I do: "I am a doctor", "I am an engineer". I will produce at work at the cost of my own health, relationships and other important aspects of my life. My guidance is a function of the demands of work, my wisdom and power come in limited areas of my work, so I am ineffective in other areas of my life.
	- Other centerness: possession, pleasure, friend&enemy, church, self.



**How to identify my center?**

- Look at table in book and see if you can identify your center. Examine your behavior and priorities and see if you can trace it back to the center from which it flows.
- I probably have a combination of different centers (e.g., spouse, money, work)
- One center might be activated until its underlying needs are satisfied, then another center becomes a person's compelling force (so I can fluctuate from one center to another).
  - I might compensate for one weakness by borrowing strength from another weakness
  - There is no persistent wisdom, direction and power, or a sense of personal/intrinsic worth and identity.
- **The ideal situation:** create one clear center based on self-invariant and constant principles from which you consistently derive a high degree of security, guidance, wisdom, and power. This center would empower my proactivity and give congruency and harmony to every part of your life. This is called having a **principle center**

- **Principle as the source of security:** our security comes from the fact that principles don't change, so we can depend on them. Other things like people, money, jobs are subject to frequent changes, so you can't depend on them. Principles won't get mad or treat us differently from day-to-day or depend on the economic environment.
  - Principles are deep and fundamental truths and they are bigger than any people or circumstance. They have been proven in thousands of years of history. We can also validate principles from personal experience; thus, giving us even more security knowing that we center our lives on proven principles that we validate every day in our lives.
  - Our principles won't change, but our understand of them does. We should search out correct principles with the confidence that the more we learn, the more clearly we can focus the lens through which we see the world.
- **Principle as the source of wisdom and guidance:** We get true wisdom and guidance from principle-centered living because we know that principles are the actual landscape, the way things really are. Basically we have the correct maps tell ys where we want to go and how we get there. We make decisions based on correct data and because of this, the implementation of our decisions is possible and meaningful.
- **Principle as the source of power:** the power that comes from principle-centered living is the power of a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors and actions of others or by circumstance and environmental infleunces. 
- The only limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves-- we can choose action based on principles, but we have no total control of the consequence of actions, even principle-based actions.
  - If I pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other.
- My map/paradigm is the source from which my attitudes and actions flow. 
- Paradigm is also like a pair of lens that affects how you see life. When looked through a set of "correct" lens (principles), I will see things differently than if I see it through lens of say "family centered paradigm".

**Writing and using a personal mission statement**

- We examine ourselves, and realign our basic/core paradigms (center) with correct principles. We create an empowering center AND a clear lens through which we see the world. We see how we as individuals relate to that world.
- We use our conscience to "detect" our missions in life (rather than inventing them). We see how our own uniqueness allow us to make contributions in life. "Everyone has his own vocation or mission in life, he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated".
- We need to work within our Circle of Influence. It's our responsibility to determine our first creation rather than letting other people or circumstances to determine it. 
- Our meaning comes from within. We should not ask what is the meaning of my life, but rather recognize that it is I who is asked. I am questioned by life, and I can only answer to life by answering for my own life-- I must be responsible for my own life. (Habit 1: personal responsibility).
  - Habit 1: you are the programmer
  - Habit 2: Write the program

- Only as a proactive person can I begin to write a personal statement that reflects who I want to be, and what I want to do with my life.
  - A concise and solid expression of your values and visions
  - A criterion by which you measure everything else in your life.
- Takes many rewrites and deep self reflection to write personal statement
  - Can take many weeks/months.
  - Need to explore innermost values
  - Need to review regularly as the passing years bring additional insights
  - The process of writing or reviewing your personal mission statement is as important as the product. It forces you to think through your priorities deeply and to align your actions to your beliefs.

- If I have a mission statement, I will not be driven by things that happen to me. I have a sense of mission about what I am trying to do and I will be excited by it



- To create personal mission statement, we need to first examine our own thoughts and values (self-awareness), then we need to use imagination and conscience-- and these are primary functions of the RIGHT side of my brain (the intuitive and creative side)
  - The more we draw on right side of brain, the more we can visualize, synthesize and transcend present time/circumstances to imagine what we want to do in life and who I want to be.
  - Exercise your right side of your brain by visualizing your own funeral, write your own eulogy (and be very specific). Use these type of visualization exercises to expand our perspective.
  - Visualize your 25th and 50th marriage anniversary. Do this with your spouse. Try to capture the essence of your relationship you want to have created by that time through day-to-day actions over a period of many years.
  - Visualize your retirement in your current work. What will you want to have achieve in your field? What contributions do you want to make by then?
  - Visualize in rich/specific detail. Involve as many emotions and feelings as possible. Involve as many senses as you can.
  - Imagine you only have 1 year left to live, visualize how I would spend that year. Things are then suddenly placed in a different perspective, values would surface that before weren't even recognized.
  - Use your imagination to put you in touch with your values-- when people seriously undertake to identify what really matters to them in their lives, what they really want to be and want to do, they start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow.



**Visualization and affirmation** **(the process by which we reprogram/rescript ourselves)**

- Personal leadership is not a singular experience. It is an ongoing process that continues even after you write your personal mission statement.
- I can use my right brain to help me become more congruent with my personal mission (deep values) in my daily life:
  - Write an "affirmation": it is a statement that is positive, personal, visual, in the present tense, and emotion.
  - I might write something like this: It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my children misbehave.
  - I visualize this affirmation (when my body is totally relaxed through mediation and deep breathing)
    - Spend a few minutes each day to think about situations where my children misbehave in rich detail: the chair I am sitting on,  the sound, my anger, make sure you don't imagine yourself as a spectator since I need to be in the role. 
    - Instead of seeing my usual response, I see myself handle to situation with the love, power, and self-control  thatI have capture in my affirmation.
  - Visualization is very important-- if I visualize the wrong thing, I will produce the wrong thing.
  - I imagine myself responding according to the script, program that I have written that is in harmony with my deepest values and as expressed in my personal mission statement.
  - I do this day after day-- then I will actually be acting from the script that I have written for myself, which stems from my own self-selected value system.

- Almost all peak performers (athletes, astronauts) are visualizers-- they see it, feel it, and experience it before they actually do it. **They begin with the end in mind.** It's like being in a simulator-- they reherase everything again and again before they do it.
- Imagine your goal relentlessly, clearly and vividly, over and over again. Create an internal comfort zone (say I am interviewing for a company). When you get to the real thing, it won't be foreign. It doesn't scare you.



- **In sum, your right side of brain is your most important asset in creating your personal mission statement and integrating it to your life.** 
- **Use visualization and affirmation.**
- In effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation emerges out of a foundation of well thought through purposes and principles that becomes (for real, not just on paper) the center of a person's life -- his action and the way he sees the world.



**Writing mission statements: identifying roles and goals**



**Identifying roles**

- The analytical and logical left brain is important  because it captures your right brain's images, feelings and pictures into words of a written mission statement.
- Writing is an action that crystallize and clarifies thoughts and helps break the whole into parts.
- Roles: I have many roles in life: husband, team member at work, son. I will find my mission statement much more balanced and easier to work with if I break it down into roles of your life and the goals you want to achieve in each area. 
- **Write mission statement in terms of the important roles in your life will give you balance and harmony. Make sure you don't get absorb by one role to the exclusion of others that are equally important in your life.**
  - What am I about as a Data Scientist, what do I want to achieve?
  - What am I about as a Son, what do I want to achieve, what values should guide me?
- Look at some examples in pg 136.



**Setting goals**

- First, identify my roles in life.
- Second, think about what long-term goals I want to achieve in each role (use imagination, creativity, conscience). These goals should be in harmony with correct principles and reflect your innermost values, unique talents and your overall mission.
- Goals should focus on results rather than activity. It identifies where you want to be, and in the process determines where you are.
- It tells you how to get there and whether or not you have arrived.
- It gives meaning to all you do.
- It translate itself into daily activities so that you are doing things each day that enable you to fulfill your goals, which stems from your personal statement. It makes you proactive since you are acting based on your own script.
- Roles and goals give structure and an organized direction to your personal mission.



**In sum, start with writing a personal statement:**

	- identify the roles in your life
	- List two to three important long-term results/goals you should achieve in each role
	- Make sure results reflect your innermost values and is in harmony with correct principles.
	- Practice Visualization and Affirmation!



- Besides individual mission statements, I can write mission statements for family and organizations as well!
