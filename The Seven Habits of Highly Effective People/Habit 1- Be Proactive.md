## The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People



### Habit 1: Be Proactive

- Humans have 4 endowments that make them  different from animals:
  - Self-awareness: Can assess our own behavior, thought processes and identify areas of weakness and things that needs to be eliminated from our lives.
  - Conscience: deep inner awareness of right or wrong, and the degree to which our thoughts and actions are aligned with our values
  - Imagination: the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality
  - Independent will: the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free from other influence.
- When things happen to me, I could decide within myself how it is going to affect me.
- Between stimulus and response, we have the freedom to choose.



**What is Proactivity?** 

* Being proactive means: 1) having the responsibility for our own lives, 2) subordinate our feelings to "carefully thought about, selected and internalized values"
* Proactive people's behavior is the product of their own choice, based on values, as opposed to a product of conditions, based on feelings.

* If we are instead reactive: 1) we choose to forfeit the responsibility for our own lives, 2) we empower conditioning and conditions to control our behavior, 3) our behavior is the product of feelings rather than values

* I don't want my actions to be controlled by how others treat me. I can choose not to be miserable. This is not like psyching myself up and letting the other person have his way, but rather doing this to gain freedom so that I will no longer be controlled by the actions of others (which I have no control).

* It is not what happens to us, but our response to what happen to us that hurts us.

* The people we admire the most are people who transcended circumstances, demonstrate their freedom to choose how they respond to difficult situations, and by doing so and express their values.

* Proactive people are realist: they face reality of the current circumstances and future projections, but they also face the reality that they had the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections.

  

**What are the signs of proactivity?**

* We can use our self-awareness to examine our behaviors and words to see if we are proactive or reactive.
  * Reactive people says things that absolves them of any responsibility. They want to transfer their responsibilities to someone else so they tell themselves they cannot choose their response:
  * There is nothing I can do
  * That's just the way I am
  * I can't
* Proactive people have the freedom to choose their action:
  * Let's look at our alternatives
  * I can choose a different approach
  * I choose



**How to be more self-aware of our degree of proactivity?**

* Circle of concern: A set of things we care about
* Circle of influence: a subset of the circle of concern. Things we care about that we also have some control over.

* Proactive people spend their time and energy on things in the circle of influence, and by doing so, actually expand that circle of influence
* Reactive people spend their time on things in the circle of concern that are outside the circle of influence.
* All problems that we face can be categorized to: 1) direct (caused by own behavior), 2) indirect (caused by behavior of others), and 3) no control.
* We can be proactive on all three types of problems. Need habit 1-3 (private victory) to handle direct problems, need habits 4-6 to change our methods of influence to handle indirect problems (public victory), we need to accept with grace and serenity and change ourselves to live with no-control problems.



**How do I know whether I am focusing on things in my circle of influence?**

* Things in circle of influence are filled with "be":
  * I have to work on "be", on what I am
    * I can be more patient
    * I can be more supportive
    * I can be a better listener
    * I can be more resourceful
    * I can be more creative
* Things in circle of concerns are filled with "have":
  * If I have more money
  * If I have a father who can help me
  * If I have more time to myself
  * If I have a better job
* If I think the problem is 'out there', that itself is the real problem. That's because we think that there are something out there that has to change before we can change. Therefore, we end up doing nothing.



**Consequence and Mistakes**

- We can choose our action and behavior, but sometimes we cannot choose the consequence that arise from those actions and behaviors. Consequences are sometimes outside our circle of influence.
- If we act, and the consequence is not what we hope for, then our action is what we call a "mistake".
- The best we can do is 1) acknowledge the mistake, 2) correct it, 3) learn from it.  We don't let the mistake to have power over us in the "next play".
- The worst we can do is 1) cover up that mistake, 2) self-deceive ourselves and convince ourselves that it is NOT a mistake, 3) and by doing so, empower that mistake to do us more harm in the future



**How to apply proactivity**

* Use our independent free will to make promise to ourselves and set internal goals
  * As we make good on our own commitments, we establish inner integrity, which in turn give us courage and strength to accept more responsibility for our own lives. At some point, the "honour" becomes bigger than our "moods/feelings".
* Work only in your circle of influence-- things you have control over 
* Focus on yourself, on "be", not "have"
* Focus on not the weakness of others (whether someone should or should not be doing things to you), but instead choose how you respond to what's happening to you. By doing so, you exercise your freedom to choose between stimulus and response.

* If you make mistake, admit it, correct it and learn from it.



**Practical tips**

* Listen to your internal language-- how often do I hear reactive phrases like "If only", "I can't", "I have to"?
* Think back to a situation in the past that you have behave reactively.
  * Is this situation within your circle of influence?
  * Use your imagination to picture how you can respond in a proactive manner. Remember to gap between stimulus and response. Make a commitment to exercise your freedom to choose next time you encounter a similar situation.
* Select a present problem in our life, determine if it is a direct, indirect, or no-control problem. Identify a first step you can take to solve your problem.
